# Reversible Logic Gates

Welcome to the Reversible Logic Gates repository! This repository provides a collection of reversible logic gates implemented using various hardware description languages. Each gate is accompanied by a description of its functionality and a corresponding gate schematic for reference.

## Feynman Gate

Feynman gate is a 2\*2 one through reversible gateas shown in figure 2. The input vector is I(A, B) and theoutput vector is O(P, Q). The outputs are defined by P=A,Q=A XOR B. Quantum cost of a Feynman gate is 1.Feynman Gate (FG) can be used as a copying gate.

## Double Feynman Gate

Double Feynman gate is 3 Ã— 3 reversible gate. It has three inputs and three outputs. It has two XOR operations at the output terminals. A double Feynman gate was developed by using 93 QCA cells and 0.75 clock latency.

## Toffoli Gate

Fig 3 shows a 3\*3 Toffoli gate. The input vector is I(A, B, C) and the output vector is O(P,Q,R). The outputsare given by P=A, Q=B, R=AB XOR C. Quantum cost of aToffoli gate is 5.

## Peres Gate
